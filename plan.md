# VP Agent Demo - Execution Plan

## Alignment with JD Requirements ✅
This plan builds exactly what the job posting asks for as the application:
- **Agent 1**: Summarizes the job description (with JSON output) ✅
- **Agent 2**: Drafts intro email in VP's voice (using writing samples) ✅
- **Agent 3**: Posts both to public GitHub repo (smart folder organization) ✅
- **Tech Stack**: LangChain.js with OpenAI (unified TypeScript stack) ✅
- **Agent Framework**: LangChain.js for orchestration ✅
- **Rapid Shipping**: MVP completed ✅
- **Full-Stack**: Next.js + Vercel deployment ✅
- **Single Language**: TypeScript throughout (backend via API routes) ✅

## Architecture Decision: JavaScript/TypeScript Only ✅
We're using 100% JavaScript/TypeScript because:
- They explicitly mention "Vercel" in the JD ✅
- Single language = faster development ✅
- Next.js API Routes replace backend ✅
- One-click Vercel deployment ✅
- Shows modern full-stack skills ✅

## Real-time Updates: Direct State Management ✅
For MVP, we're using:
- Direct state management with React Context ✅
- Step-by-step wizard progression ✅
- Immediate feedback on each action ✅
- No need for polling or WebSockets ✅

## Development Approach: Local First, Vercel Ready ✅
1. **Start Local** - Everything working locally ✅
2. **Use GitHub CLI** - Leveraging existing `gh` auth for local development ✅
3. **Deploy Later** - Ready for Vercel deployment with GitHub token ✅
